The boil time is listed in the recipe here on brewers friend.  Its 90 minutes.  If you're going to tackle an all grain recipe you'll either need to get a bigger pot or modify it to extract.

I don't check the comments here too often so sorry its taken me a year to get back to you on this.  Better late than never though.This one turned out pretty good.  The brewer gives the grains/hops used but no times/amounts so mine is a guess but I would say it was pretty close.  One thing that confused me on this one was the addition of the black malt.  Switchback listed it as one of the grains so I went with it.  Color was way off from original but taste was great.  Me and the guys polished off the keg during a night of poker and all enjoyed it.  Also its been a year so not sure if you're able to culture yeast yet but that will have a significant effect on the final product.  Its super easy to culture so I'd recommend it.", "thanks Jim.
